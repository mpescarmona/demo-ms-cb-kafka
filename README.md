# Microservice with Kafka and Resilience4j using Spring Boot 2 demo

This demo shows how a Spring Boot 2 microservice consumes from a Kafka topic and uses the fault tolerance library [Resilience4j](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j) to isolate from fails in mongoDb database.

See [Resilience4j User Guide](https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/getting-started-3) for more details. 

## Getting Started

To run the complete Demo application, just run the 01-start.sh bash script.
```
./01-start.sh
```
This script will:
 - Start the docker machine on your local machine, 
 - Build the application image
 - Start the docker images
 - Display the application logs

To stop the Demo application, just run:
```
./02-stop.sh
```

## Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

The provided docker-compose file will deploy the following things in your local machine:
 - [Swagger documentation](http://192.168.99.102:8081/swagger-ui.html#) page
 - [Prometheus](http://192.168.99.102:9090) methics UI
 - [Grafana](http://192.168.99.102:3000) with Resilience4j Dashboard. (User: admin, Password: root)
